                    <p>  Mdina’s baroque-style main gate, built in 1724, during the magistracy of Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena, is the first attraction you’ll see.
                        The Mdina Gate can be seen in Game of Thrones, it's the original King’s Landing. The town’s elegant gate can be seen in the first season (episode 3) of
                        Game of Thrones.</p>

                    <p>The majestic Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Paul was designed by the world-famous Maltese architect, Lorenzo Gafà. The magnificent dome, the breathtaking
                      paintings and the grand Corinthian columns on the façade made Saint Paul’s Cathedral a 17th-century architectural masterpiece. And definitely one of the best
                      things to see in Mdina. On the other side of St Paul’s Square, you can access Mdina Cathedral Museum using the same ticket. Its collections include ecclesiastical
                      objects of sacred art, Roman antiquities and many masterpieces of European painters. </p>

                    <p>This magnificent 13th–century palazzo is the second oldest building in Mdina. An extensive restoration in 2007, turned the house into a state-of-the-art Museum. 
                      During the Middle Ages, the palace was owned by Maltese nobles with the last one being Olof Frederick Gollcher. A keen collector and a frequent traveller he restored
                      the Palazzo and turned it into an extraordinary treasure trove. Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum exhibits his collections; oriental rugs, fine paintings, archaeological
                      artifacts, antique furniture, jewellery, weapons and a library with more than 4,500 volumes.</p>

                      were all replaced by lawn and stone paving. Today, the gardens are a popular attraction, providing a quiet spot and beautiful views over the fortified city. What is more, 
                      they are regularly being used for food fairs, concerts and festivals, so make sure to ask in the tourist office.</p>

                      bust of Vilhena proudly stands while the Grand Master’s coat-of-arms are sculptured both on the main door and inside the portico. Over the palace’s side façade there’s a statue
                      representing Justice. The fact that this one is not blindfolded signals that justice is all-seeing and all-knowing. As a former law court, the Vilhena Palace houses several cells.</p>

                    <p>Narrow and winding, the cobbled streets of Mdina witnessed numerous wars and battles. The medieval city has many tales to unfold; historical gossip, stories of sacrifice,
                      joy, love and even some with an eerie and mysterious twist. Large squares with flowers, tall bastions, baroque buildings and impressive palaces come out surprisingly in 
                      every corner.Roam through Mdina’s quaint streets, once trod by nobles and knights, and listen to the Silent City. Getting lost in that maze is definitely one of the best
                      things to do in the old capital (if not the best).</p>

                    <p>The second entrance to Mdina, the Greeks Gate, is less ornate than the main gate and was built in the medieval era. However, in 1724, Charles François de Mondion, added an outer
                      structure, in… baroque style. So the gate consists of two vaulted gateways. The inner medieval and the outer baroque. Once you enter through the gate you will find yourself in a 
                      small square called Piazza dei Greci, which connects to a number of roads leading to different parts of Mdina.</p>
                  <p> Did you know? The gate got its name from a small community of Greeks living close to the gate. This was also the only entrance into Mdina the slaves were allowed to use.</p>

                      oldest building in Mdina. The oldest part of the exterior contains a square-headed window surrounded by a moulding carrying the date 1233. However,
                      it was not until 1938 that the second floor was added.</p>

                        the Silent City so a ride with it is an excellent option to enjoy Mdina’s architecture. Nevertheless, the best way to explore Mdina is on foot, if you 
                        have the opportunity and the time. How much does it cost? The prices range from 20€ to 35€, however, you can get a better deal if you haggle.</p>

                    <p>San Anton Gardens are located in Attard near Mdina and is one of the most beautiful gardens in Malta with a large variety of beautiful flowers and plants.
                      This garden has been open to the public since 1882 and it was built by Grand Master Antoine de Paule to complement his summer residence, San Anton Palace,
                      which today is the residence of the Maltese President.</p>

                    <p>Just outside of Mdina is the town of Rabat. St. Dominic’s Priory is a small church with a quaint courtyard
                        that you can visit during opening hours. The scene filmed here is when Ned Stark confronts Cersei Lannister
                        about having an relationship with her twin brother. Throughout the conversation, they are standing in the
                        center of the courtyard of St. Dominic’s Priory. While you cannot enter the courtyard, you can walk along
                        the cloister to get the same viewpoint as the scene was shot! It now has some pots of plants that weren’t
                        there during filming, but otherwise, it’s incredibly recognizable if you’re familiar with the scene.</p>
