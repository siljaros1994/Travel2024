                    <p>Balluta Bay on the northern edge of Sliema lets the clear waters of the Med roll over white-tinted pebbles. On one side, the Gothic filigrees of the Carmelite Parish
                      Church draw the eye. Behind is a bustling piazza where you can sit with a coffee and watch the world go by. During the summer months, Balluta Bay is a favourite local
                      swimming spot. More of a classic beach than the rocky headlands elsewhere in the town, it's got space for laying the towel and soaking up the rays. You might want to
                      bring the snorkel along, too – there are some interesting fish-filled reefs lining the bay.</p>
