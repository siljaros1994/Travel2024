                    <p>The Blessed Virgin of Ta' Pinu Basilica is a soaring structure between the villages of Gharb and Ghammar. Built between 1920 and 1931, it’s the destination
                      for various religious pilgrimages in Gozo. This beautiful church also houses a wealth of sculptures and crafts produced from Maltese stone. The church’s
                      neo-romantic design includes 6 mosaics and an array of stained-glass windows, with a steeple that rises to a towering 61 metres high. Opposite the
                      Basilica along Ghammar Hill, there's a series of 14 marble statues depicting the Via Crucis or the Stations of the Cross.</p>

                    <p>The Gozo Cittadella dates back to the Middle Ages, positioned on a lofty hillside and surrounded by ancient walls that kept foreign raiders out.
                      Today, this alluring centrepiece of Rabat (Victoria) – Gozo's largest city – presents you with a myriad of laneways, markets, shops and other staples
                      of Maltese culture. Many of the Cittadella’s greatest buildings remain only in ruins, but several have been kept fully in use despite their age, 
                      including the Old Courts of Law and the Old Governor's Palace. Plus, there's an array of museums showcasing artefacts and trinkets. Be sure to head
                      to the central marketplace of It-Tokk to find some great local produce and garments.</p>

                    <h3>Dwejra Bay - Wonderful snorkelling and rock formations</h3>
                    <p>Dwejra Bay is a striking destination on the west coast of Gozo. Named after a small house that once occupied the beachfront, the shallow waters extend
                      into a stunning 60-metre-long cave. Part of the reason that locals and tourists flock to this bay is for the striking rock formations, which have been 
                      naturally carved out over thousands of years. Dwejra Bay is also popular among those who enjoy snorkelling. There are plenty of underwater scenes to enjoy,
                      either in the shallows or the Blue Hole, a nearby picturesque dive site. There's also the possibility of soaking up the scenery from a fishing boat, which 
                      travels around from the other side of the cliffs.</p>

                    <p>The Villa Rundle Gardens provide a serene haven away from Rabat's busy streets during the peak of Malta's tourist season. The garden was named after British
                      General Leslie Rundle, who established it in 1915. Featuring a variety of local and imported species, this central oasis is where you can escape the heat
                      underneath Canary Palm trees. Set around a towering fountain, the garden's connected paths are dotted with modern and classical sculptures. Once the sun
                      goes down, the garden is lit up with colourful decorations. The Villa Rundle Gardens are a tranquil spot to catch your breath after a long day of sightseeing
                      and swimming in Rabat. </p>

                    <p>Marsalforn Bay is a pebble-and-sand beach that offers outstanding swimming, sunbathing and snorkelling opportunities. It’s a popular summertime destination located
                      around 4.5 km north-east of Rabat (Victoria). The surrounding waterfront promenade stretches the entire length of the bay, offering some unbeatable views. 
                      Set between numerous hotels and guesthouses, the promenade has great restaurants and bars serving delicious Gozitan cuisine and cold drinks. Pick a spot
                      with terrace dining and enjoy a meal as you overlook Marsalforn Bay’s immaculate landscape. Many of the venues stay open late into the night, lighting up

                    <p>Tal-Massar Winery offers insight into the island's much-loved Gozitan cuisine. Since 1934, the estate has been passed down through generations who have
                      maintained the row of vines spread across the countryside. The winery is open for vineyard tours and wine tastings every Tuesday and Saturday. Here, you'll
                      learn about the estate's history and the expertise it takes to produce consistently great tasting wine. You'll also get to meet the owners and experience
                      some incredible views of the surrounding countryside and medieval towns. Alongside a selection of wines, the tour comes with 3 Gozitan-style finger foods,

                    <p>Ggantija Temple is a significant archaeological landmark on the island of Gozo. The UNESCO World Heritage site was excavated throughout the 19th century. 
                      It features huge slabs of limestone that are over 5 metres in length and weighing over 50 tonnes. Built between 3,600 and 3,200 BC, Ggantija Temple is
                      remarkably well-preserved. The interior offers examples of limestone that has been carved to create furnishings, doorways and altars. Evidence also
                      suggests that the temple was once plastered and painted, with red ochre found on the walls.</p>

                    <p>The Azure Window was one of the great natural phenomena of Gozo, and it was even featured in television shows like Game of Thrones. Sadly, it collapsed in 2017,
                      but that doesn’t make the site any less worthy of a visit. Hike along the Dwejra Bay for as long as you’d like, taking in the views of the craggy coastline and 
                      seeing other special sites like The Fungus Rock, the Blue Hole, and the Inland Sea lagoon. </p>

                      Cittadella is believed to have been the acropolis of the Punic-Roman city of Gaulos or Glauconis Civitas.</p>
