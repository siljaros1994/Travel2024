                    <h3>The Parish Church</h3>
                    <p>The Parish Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary is a Roman Catholic parish church in Mellieħa, Malta, dedicated to the Nativity of Mary.
                      It was built between 1881 and 1898, and the dome and bell towers were completed between 1920 and 1940.The parish of Mellieħa was first established
                      in the 15th century or earlier, but in later centuries the village ceased to be a parish since the settlement was prone to attacks from the Barbary
                      pirates and it was abandoned. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieħa remained an important shrine, and after the corsair threat had diminished the
                      village began to grow once again. The parish was re-established in 1844. </p>

                    <p>Mellieħa Bay is Malta’s largest, and most popularly visited beach, and is located in the North of the main island, on the outskirts of the village of Mellieħa.
                      The beach is roughly 800m long and was awarded Blue Flag status (which is a recognition of quality based on water quality, environmental management, safety and
                      services, among other indicators). With a gentle slope towards deeper waters, Mellieħa Bay is a great beach for swimming with the family. Plenty of facilities are 
                      available around the edge of the beach and various water sports (sea kayaking, waterskiing, windsurfing,) are available.</p>

                    <p>The Rotunda of Mosta or Mosta Dome is the name given to the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady located in the city of Mosta in the Northern Region of Malta.
                      The design of the church is based on the Pantheon in Rome! What is interesting about the Rotunda is that it was almost destroyed during World War II. On April 9, 1942,
                      a German bomb pierced the dome of the church but never exploded, while two other bombs bounced off the dome and landed in the square without exploding either. 
                      This event became known as a miracle by Maltese people because more than 300 people were awaiting evening mass when it happened. You can now find a replica of the bomb
                      inside that church, dedicated to this miraculous event.</p>
