                    <h3>Tigné Point Beach</h3>
                    <p>Tigné Point Beach runs around the edge of Sliema, beneath the walls of old Fort Tigné. You can reach it by following the concrete paths
                      and steps that wiggle through the district straight to the shoreline. But don't come expecting a beach in the classic sense. This one's more
                      of a rocky outcrop where the Med bashes into the coves and inlets. Crowds come to cool off around Tigné Point Beach during the summer months.
                      The water is clear and refreshing between May and October. In the winter, you might also catch some daring locals taking the plunge. 
                      One thing that stays the same is the view, however, which includes a panorama of historic Valletta and the dome of St. John's Co-Cathedral over the strait. </p>

                    <p>The Sliema promenade links up the whole of the town as it weaves around the coast from Tigné Point to the vibrant bays of Saint Julian in the north.
                      The locals call it, simply, The Front. It's their main gathering spot, where joggers, dog walkers, café hoppers, and cocktail sippers meet after work
                      and in the evenings.It's also a great place to go to seek out some of Sliema's more historic landmarks. The square-cut Torri ta' San Giljan looms high
                      about halfway along the prom. It dates back to the 1600s and has seen hard-fought artillery battles in its time. Move a little to the south of that and
                      you'll find the quirky Independence Garden. It's been commandeered by cats as a sleeping spot, but also has babbling baroque fountains and sweeping views
                      of the sea.</p>

                    <h3>Fort Tigné</h3>
                    <p>The walls of Fort Tigné have been keeping watch over the entrance to Marsamxett Harbour since the late 18th century. That's when this muscular castle was raised
                      by the Knights of St John. They were soon glad they'd built it, too, because Napoleon attempted to grab the island in 1798, and this became a major point of
                      resistance against the French armies. After the turn of the millennium, the whole area inside Fort Tigné was totally redeveloped. Chic apartment blocks peering
                      over the Mediterranean Sea sprouted from the old barracks. Parks and promenades popped up on the stone walls. Head into all that to find a place for the sunset
                      hour on the coast. The panoramic views of Valletta are second to none.</p>

                    <h3>Manoel Island</h3>
                    <p>Manoel Island juts out into the middle of the harbour just south of Sliema. It's an unusual corner of the city that seems to have resisted modern development
                      just a little better than its compadres on the mainland. For example, there are still steep slopes clad in scrub next to limestone boulders sprayed by the waves
                      of the Med. Crowning the lot are the buildings of the Lazzaretto and Fort Manoel. The first was built in the 1500s as a place to quarantine victims of the Black Death.
                       The second was an addition to the great fortifications of the Knights of St John, and later a British barracks in WWII. Other sights on Manoel Island include the curious
                        Duck Village – for encounters with quacking residents – and the Yacht Yard – for glimpses of expensive catamarans. Fort Manoel on Manoel Island is transformed into
                         the Great Sept of Baelor and acts as the location where Joffrey has Ned Stark decapitated in front of his daughters Sansa and Arya Stark’s gaze in the first truly
                        unexpected death of the series.</p>

                    <p>The Fond Ghadir is a series of manmade bathing pools in Sliema. While locals refer to them as the Roman Baths, the pools actually date to the 1800s.
                      They carve into the coastline on the northern edge of Sliema, just beneath the ramparts of Tower Road. Originally salt pans, they've now been commandeered by
                      swimmers and sunbathers, at least for the summer. Head down with the towel and the trunks in tow. There are plenty of places to laze and relax. When things 
                      get too hot, hop into one of the square-cut pools. They're like a natural bubble bath with crystal-clear water and ample protection from the strongest waves.</p>

                    <p>In the backstreets that roll between Marsamxett Harbour and vibrant Spinola Bay, there are all sorts of treasures just waiting to be uncovered.
                      A short stroll up the streets around Manwel Dimech and San Piju V reveals cosy cafés, Italian-style bread makers, jewellery stalls, and quaint cottages
                      with painted shutters. Beyond that is the honey-coloured baroque face of the Parish Church of Sacro Cuor – one for avid photographers. Explore around that
                      and you'll be further surprised by the big towers of the Parish Church of St. Gregory the Great, which keeps watch over piazzas and narrow alleys.</p>

                    <p>The coast of Sliema is filled with several man-made tidal pools that locals have dubbed “Roman Baths.” These square-shaped pools were developed sometime in
                      the 17th century and are now considered one of the best things to do in Malta. The baths are cleverly carved alongside one another and link to the city’s 
                      drainage systems to avoid flooding. If you spend time at the promenade, you will encounter the popular baths of Font Ghadir Beach.</p>
