                    <h3>Popeye Village </h3>
                    <p> The set from Robert Altman's film Popeye, shot in Malta, was never fully struck and remains on the island as a sort of misplaced relic.
                      The live-action film based on the popular comic strip and animation character, a spinach-loving sailor, marked the film debut of Robin Williams in the title role.
                      Over 20 wooden structures were built with the tree trunk logs imported from Holland and wooden shingles brought in from Canada, making the town quite the production. 
                      Eight tons of nails and 250 gallons of paint were used in constructing the set, and a 250-foot breakwater was built to protect the filming area from the high seas.
                      The film itself was a box-office bomb. But rather than tearing the set down or leaving it abandoned, the islanders saw it for what it was: a pre-built theme park.
                      They eventually took over the abandoned set, hired actors, and the Popeye Village was born.  </p>

                    <p>Nestled along the rugged coastline of Comino, an island in the heart of the Mediterranean, lies the Popeye Cave—a hidden gem that adds a touch of mystery to this 
                      enchanting destination. Steeped in both natural beauty and cinematic history, the cave offers visitors a unique blend of geological wonders and the whimsy of a beloved film icon.</p>

                    <p> One of the silliest things to do in Popeye Village is play a round of festive mini-golf. Yep, no matter what the season, you can whack a ball around through the candy cane course
                      and see if you can hit a snowman in the eye.</p>

                    <p>If you’re a fan of the film, or just a Popeye fan in general, you’ll love all the memorabilia on display. From comics to toys to novelty spinach cans, it’s really interesting to see the Popeye
                      influence in pop culture over the years. The gift shop is also pretty good (and reasonably priced!), so if you want a Popeye mug or soft toy to take home, you can pick some cool things up here. </p>

                      your visit by buying a souvenir in one of the shops in the park.</p>
