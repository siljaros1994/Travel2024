                    <p>The Crystal Lagoon is a hidden gem on Comino Island. It is named for its crystal-clear waters and is often outranked by its more famous sibling, the Blue Lagoon.
                      Although less renowned, the Crystal Lagoon boasts a beauty that rivals its well-known counterpart.The pristine waters are welcomed by cliffs along the shore,
                      making access only by a boat trip. As a quieter and less famous choice to the Blue Lagoon, the Crystal Lagoon offers a tranquil area for swimming and snorkelling
                      in the refreshing waters.</p>

                      This stunning bay features a small sandy beach and offers a tranquil escape for visitors. While the Blue Lagoon captures widespread attention,

                      on Comino, reveals several small sea caves and a striking limestone cliff line that contrasts with the blue waters beneath. Dive into the beauty of

                    <p>The island of Comino boasts the tiniest man-made constructions, and that's a noteworthy part of its charm. Among the structures that have withstood
                      the test of time, stands out as the most amazing. This early 17th-century watchtower was pitched by the Knights of the Order of Saint John as a defensive
                      action against pirates. While not unique, as similar defensive towers exist around Malta, St Mary's Tower is a symbolic piece of history. Recently restored
                      and opened to the public, this historic square building served various purposes over the centuries, including as a prison and bird-protection sanctuary.
                      Inside St Mary's Tower, visitors can explore a map showcasing all the defensive towers spread across Malta and Gozo.</p>

                    <p>The sole religious structure on Comino Island is a Roman Catholic chapel dedicated to Our Lady's Return From Egypt. This 400-year-old Comino chapel
                      overlooking the bay of Santa Marija features a unique display of three bells within a trio of archways atop its top. While the exterior presents a simple
                      and ancient facade, the chapel's interior reveals a striking Neo-Gothic style with pointed archways. Although there are no official opening hours, the 
                      chapel on the island of Comino is noteworthy, even from the outside.</p>

                    <p>Located on the North of the island, St. Nicholas Bay, served as the ferry entry point to the Comino Hotel. This small beach with lovely crystal-clear 
                      waters is a hidden gem for snorkelling. St. Nicholas Bay is a popular destination for water activities, offering a tranquil alternative to the busy
                      Blue Lagoon and ensuring a less crowded experience. Beyond its appeal in the summer, this bay retains its charm during the winter, inviting visitors
                      to experience island walks and observations of nature. The area is renowned for winter hikes and trekking, with calm seas providing an ideal setting
                      for a swim with a fantastic view.</p>

                    <p>The Isolation Hospital, built by the British in the 1890s, is Comino’s largest historic building. The hospital served as a quarantine station for British troops
                      returning to Malta from the cholera-stricken Levant. While the building lies largely in a state of disrepair, military buffs will doubtlessly find its ghostly,
                      abandoned wards fascinating.</p>
